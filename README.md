Project Title: Peace of Mind

Peace of Mind is a password-protected diary that will allow you to keep
ideas to yourself. Users can make their own accounts and log in using their
usernames and password to access their personal diaries. When you enter,
you will be taken to the main page where you can add as many chapters as
you like, and you are free to write anything. They can also access past
entries by searching for the date of the past entry.
The design component includes an “on/off” button located on the bottom
right that will change the background based on the season (e.g., snowy
background for the winter season). The user can choose to turn the design
on or keep it simple by turning it off. Additional features on the website
include a mini-calendar, weather widgets on the right-hand side of every
page, and the date and time on the top left.

Functional Requirements:
1. Users create an account using a username and password to access their personal diaries
2. The user’s account password must include letters, numbers, and special characters
(e.g.!) and must be a minimum of 8 characters long
3. The user will only have 3 attempts to input the password correctly or else the account
will be temporarily locked
4. The username of the user’s account must be between 7-10 characters long with both
letters and numbers
5. If a user gets locked out of their account, they must answer a security question to gain
access again
6. The user must provide their phone number and email address &amp; click “forget
password?” if they wish to reset their password
7. The user can create a new account by clicking “Create new account”
8. The user can input the day, month, and year into “Enter date:” to access past diary
entries from that specific date
9. The user can use the design “on/off” button to implement background design (seasonal)
10. The user can add a title of their choosing to each diary entry
